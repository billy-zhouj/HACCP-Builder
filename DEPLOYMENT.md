# Deploying HACCP-Builder: GitHub → Render

This walks through pushing the project to GitHub and running it on Render,
using Render's own managed Postgres for the database (Render's app
filesystem is ephemeral — this project's `prisma/schema.prisma` is already
set to `postgresql`, so no schema change is needed before you start).

Total time: 30–45 minutes for a first deploy.

## 0. What you'll need

- A free [GitHub](https://github.com) account
- A free [Render](https://render.com) account (can sign up with GitHub)
- Node 18+ installed locally (to generate a `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and, if you
  want, to test the Postgres connection before deploying)

## 1. Put the project on GitHub

1. Unzip this project locally if you haven't already (`haccp-builder/`).
2. In that folder, initialize git and make the first commit:

   ```bash
   cd haccp-builder
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

   The included `.gitignore` already excludes `node_modules`, `.next`,
   `.env`, and any local `dev.db` — double check `git status` doesn't show
   any of those before committing.
3. Create a new repository on GitHub (no README/license — you already have
   files): go to github.com → **New repository** → name it e.g.
   `haccp-builder` → **Create repository**.
4. Push:

   ```bash
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/haccp-builder.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## 2. Create the Postgres database on Render

1. Log into [Render](https://dashboard.render.com).
2. **New** → **PostgreSQL**.
3. Name it e.g. `haccp-builder-db`, pick a region, leave the free plan
   selected for testing (upgrade later for production — the free Postgres
   tier is deleted after 30 days of inactivity/expiry).
4. Click **Create Database**. Wait for it to become "Available."
5. On the database's page, copy the **Internal Database URL** (for the web
   service, same region) or the **External Database URL** (to run
   migrations from your own machine, or open Prisma Studio). Keep this tab
   open; you'll need the value in step 4.

## 3. Create the web service on Render

1. **New** → **Web Service**.
2. Connect your GitHub account if you haven't, then select the
   `haccp-builder` repo.
3. Fill in:
   - **Name:** `haccp-builder` (this becomes part of your default URL:
     `haccp-builder.onrender.com`)
   - **Region:** same region you picked for the database
   - **Branch:** `main`
   - **Runtime:** Node
   - **Build Command:**
     ```
     npm install && npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate deploy && npm run build
     ```
     (`migrate deploy` applies your Prisma migrations to the production
     database non-interactively — safe to run on every deploy. The very
     first deploy will have no migration files yet — see step 5 below.)
   - **Start Command:** `npm run start`
   - **Instance Type:** Free is fine to confirm everything works; move to a
     paid instance before relying on this for real customers (the free
     tier spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity).
4. Don't click Create yet — add environment variables first (next step).

## 4. Set environment variables

Still on the web service creation screen, scroll to **Environment
Variables** and add:

| Key | Value |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | The Internal Database URL you copied in step 2 |
| `NEXTAUTH_URL` | `https://haccp-builder.onrender.com` |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` | Same as `NEXTAUTH_URL` — drives SEO metadata, the sitemap, and robots.txt |
| `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` | A long random string — generate one locally with `openssl rand -base64 32` |
| `DEFAULT_RETENTION_DAYS` | `90` |
| `ALLOW_FREE_UNLOCK` | `true` while testing pre-launch; remove once Stripe is live |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Leave blank for now to launch in dev-mode-unlock (see below), or your real Stripe secret key once you're ready to take payments |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Same — blank until you wire up real billing |
| `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ONE_TIME` | Same |
| `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_STORAGE_SUBSCRIPTION` | Same |
| `CRON_SECRET` | A long random string — protects the scheduled retention-purge endpoint (see §"Retention purge" below). Leave blank to disable the endpoint (it returns 501) |
| `RETENTION_PURGE_BATCH` | `500` — max plans purged per cron run |

Click **Create Web Service**. Render will pull the repo, run the build
command, and start it — watch the **Logs** tab for progress.

## 5. First deploy: create the initial migration

This project doesn't ship with a `prisma/migrations` folder yet (migrations
were never generated in the sandboxed environment it was built in — see the
README's "Running locally" verification note). You need to generate that
folder once, against your real Postgres database, and commit it — after
that, every future deploy's `migrate deploy` step will pick up new
migrations automatically.

The simplest way: run it from your own machine, pointed at the Render
database, then push the generated files.

1. In your local `haccp-builder` folder, create a `.env` (copy
   `.env.example`) and set `DATABASE_URL` to the **External Database URL**
   from step 2.
2. Run:

   ```bash
   npm install
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

   This creates `prisma/migrations/<timestamp>_init/` with the SQL to build
   every table, and applies it directly to your Render Postgres database.
3. Commit and push the migration folder:

   ```bash
   git add prisma/migrations
   git commit -m "Add initial Postgres migration"
   git push
   ```
4. Render will auto-redeploy on the push. From now on, whenever you change
   `prisma/schema.prisma`, run `npx prisma migrate dev --name <description>`
   locally (against a dev database), commit the new migration folder, and
   push; Render's build command applies it automatically via
   `migrate deploy`.

**Note on local development going forward:** local dev needs a Postgres
database too (SQLite isn't used here). Easiest options: point your local
`.env` at the same Render database temporarily (fine while you're the only
user), spin up a free database on [Neon](https://neon.tech) or
[Supabase](https://supabase.com) for local dev, or run Postgres in Docker.

## 6. Verify

1. Once the deploy finishes (Logs tab shows the app listening), visit your
   Render URL (`https://haccp-builder.onrender.com` by default).
2. Register an account, create a plan, walk through the wizard.
3. On Review & Export, since `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is blank, you'll see a
   "(Dev mode) Simulate unlock" button — use it to confirm the `.docx`
   export works end-to-end in production.

## 7. Going live with billing (when ready)

1. Create a [Stripe](https://stripe.com) account, create two Prices: one
   one-time (the plan unlock fee) and one recurring (the storage
   subscription).
2. In Render's environment variables, set `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`,
   `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_ONE_TIME`, and `STRIPE_PRICE_ID_STORAGE_SUBSCRIPTION`.
3. In the Stripe dashboard, add a webhook endpoint pointing at
   `https://<your-render-url>/api/billing/webhook`, subscribed to the
   checkout/payment events the app listens for; copy the resulting signing
   secret into `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` on Render.
4. Render redeploys automatically when you save environment variable
   changes. The dev-mode "Simulate unlock" button disappears automatically
   once `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` is set, and real Stripe Checkout takes over.

## SEO

What's already wired up in the code:

- **Metadata** (`src/lib/seo.ts`, used from `src/app/layout.tsx`): page
  titles, meta description, keywords, canonical URLs, and Open Graph/
  Twitter card tags — all driven off `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL`.
- **`/robots.txt`** (`src/app/robots.ts`) — allows crawling of the public
  marketing pages, explicitly blocks `/dashboard`, `/plans`, and `/api`.
- **`/sitemap.xml`** (`src/app/sitemap.ts`) — lists the public pages only.
- **JSON-LD structured data** (in `layout.tsx`) — a `SoftwareApplication`
  schema block.
- **Auto-generated OG image and favicon** (`src/app/opengraph-image.tsx`,
  `src/app/icon.tsx`) — swap in real branded assets whenever you have them.

## Ongoing workflow

From here on, deploying is just: commit, push to `main`, Render auto-builds
and redeploys. Any schema change needs a migration generated locally
(`npx prisma migrate dev --name ...`) and committed alongside the code
change, same as step 5.

## Retention purge

Plan data on the free / one-time-unlock tier is retained for
`DEFAULT_RETENTION_DAYS` (90) and then purged, unless the owner has an active
storage subscription (in which case `retentionExpiresAt` is null and the plan
is kept indefinitely). The purge itself runs via an authenticated cron
endpoint:

```
POST /api/cron/retention-purge
Authorization: Bearer <CRON_SECRET>
```

It (1) re-anchors plans whose owner's subscription has lapsed — giving them a
fresh 90-day window — and (2) deletes plans whose `retentionExpiresAt` is in
the past (cascading to all child rows). It is idempotent and safe to re-run.
The endpoint refuses to run (501) if `CRON_SECRET` is unset, and returns 401
if the bearer token doesn't match.

Schedule it to run **daily** (e.g. 03:00 UTC). Options:

- **Render Cron Job:** create a Cron Job service (New → Cron Job), schedule
  `0 3 * * *`, build command `npm install`, command:
  ```
  curl -s -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $CRON_SECRET" https://<your-render-url>/api/cron/retention-purge
  ```
  (set `CRON_SECRET` as an env var on the cron job, matching the web service).
- **External monitor:** [cron-job.org](https://cron-job.org) or
  [UptimeRobot](https://uptimerobot.com) with a daily schedule hitting the URL
  with the `Authorization` header.
- **GitHub Action:** a scheduled workflow using `actions/curl` or a `fetch`
  step against the endpoint.

If you'd rather not run the purge as HTTP, the core logic is in
`src/lib/retention.ts` (`purgeExpiredPlans`) and can be called from a
standalone `tsx` script run by any scheduler.
